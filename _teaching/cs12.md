Independently designed and taught a term-long course that provides students with a practical and theoretical foundation in computer vision. Covered fundamental topics and advanced topics such as generative modeling and 3D vision, drawing from my own research. Taught 23 total students, including undergraduate and graduate students. Planning to teach updated course covering diffusion models in 2024. [[Course Website]](https://sites.google.com/view/cs-12-cv-for-research/home?authuser=0)
