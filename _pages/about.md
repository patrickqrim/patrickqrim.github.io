I'm a final year undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) studying Computer Science with a minor in Information and Data Sciences.

Research Interests
======
Currently, I am interested in computer vision, generative modeling, representation learning, and AI for science. I have explored the end-to-end learning pipeline from data collection to model construction, achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining focus on practical applications. I am interested in developing methods to solve fundamental vision tasks and in constructing generative and predictive models for science. Specifically, I explore diffusion models for a diverse range of tasks, from 3D segmentation to animal trajectory generation. I believe methods yielding robust, versatile, and interpretable representations of data can more effectively solve real-world problems.
