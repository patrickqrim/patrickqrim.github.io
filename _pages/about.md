I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at Yale University in Prof. Alex Wong's [Yale Vision Laboratory](https://vision.cs.yale.edu/). Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Information and Data Sciences at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

### Research Interests
Currently, I am interested in 3D computer vision, generative modeling, representation learning, and AI for science. I have explored the end-to-end learning pipeline from data collection to model construction, achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining focus on practical applications. I am interested in developing methods to solve fundamental vision tasks and in constructing generative and predictive models for science. Specifically, I explore diffusion models for a diverse range of tasks, from 3D point-cloud segmentation to animal trajectory generation. I believe methods yielding robust, versatile, and interpretable representations of data can more effectively solve real-world problems.
