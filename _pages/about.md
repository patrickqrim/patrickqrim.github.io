I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Yale Vision Lab](https://vision.cs.yale.edu/) researching 3D vision and multimodal AI systems, advised by Prof. Alex Wong. Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Information/Data Sciences at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/) (Caltech).

I am also currently a Research Scientist Intern at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), working on the Extended Reality (XR) team with Kun He to build something new and ambitious! ðŸš€

### What I Research and Why
My work is centered on building embodied AI agents with adaptive, efficient, and robust perception, as well as multimodal capabilities spanning vision, language, and range sensing.
To that end, I develop methods for **recognition** (e.g., multi-sensor 3D object detection in autonomous driving and AR/VR settings), **reconstruction** (e.g., forecasting dynamic scenes by learning latent ODEs that temporally extrapolate deformable 3D Gaussian splats), and **generation** (e.g., text-conditional depth map generation with diffusion models).
Currently, I am exploring in-the-wild egocentric hand-object tracking to enable contextualized input in unconstrained real-world environments.
