I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at Yale University in Prof. Alex Wong's [Yale Vision Laboratory](https://vision.cs.yale.edu/). Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Information and Data Sciences at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

### Research Interests
My research centers on advancing embodied AI with multimodal sensing (specifically, vision + language) for 3D recognition, reconstruction, and generation tasks. Within this broader goal, my current work focuses on learning robust representations for sensor fusion—that is, combining inputs from cameras and range sensors (e.g., lidar/radar)—in challenging and dynamic settings, such as those encountered in unsupervised continual learning of depth completion. I have developed a method that mitigates catastrophic forgetting by leveraging prototype sets as selective biases, and I am extending this approach to continual neural radiance fields, or NeRFs. Additionally, I am working on using language priors with diffusion models for depth estimation, recovering depth in occluded regions, and energy-based test-time adaptation. In the past, I’ve explored fundamental 3D vision and representation learning, creating methods for tasks such as 3D object detection and point-cloud segmentation that are critical for applications like robotics and autonomous driving, as well as scientific problems like animal trajectory prediction.
