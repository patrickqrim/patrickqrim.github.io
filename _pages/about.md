I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at the [Yale Vision Lab](https://vision.cs.yale.edu/) researching 3D Vision for AI, advised by Prof. Alex Wong. Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Information/Data Sciences at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/) (Caltech).

I am also currently a Research Scientist Intern at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), working on the Extended Reality (XR) team with Kun He to build something completely new and exciting!

### What I Research and Why
My work is centered on building superintelligent embodied AI agents with adaptive, efficient, robust egocentric perception, as well as multimodal capabilities spanning vision, range sensing, language, and audio.
To that end, I develop methods for **recognition** (e.g., multi-sensor 3D object detection in autonomous driving and AR/VR settings), **reconstruction** (e.g., forecasting the motion of deformable 3D Gaussian splats over time using latent ODEs), and **generation** (e.g., text-conditional depth map generation with diffusion models).
Currently, I am exploring in-the-wild egocentric hand-object tracking to enable contextualized input in unconstrained real-world environments.
